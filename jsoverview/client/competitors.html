    <h3>SFDC vs. Pega</h3>
    <p>People are integrating SFDC with React</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can bet that most SFDC tailored demos will have amazing visuals</p>
    <br>
    <p>They will tout their use of frameworks and wave the names Google,
    Facebook, etc. around</p>

    <h3>Appery and JS</h3>
    <p>All JavaScript, all cloud toy builder for cross-platform apps</p>
    <br>
    <p>Extremely transparent (and cheap) pricing. Signup in 30 seconds without
    credit card</p>
    <br>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://appery.io/partners/">Appery's Strategic
      Partners</a>
    <p>There will be a cloud based, JS BPM / Case Management vendor. And it
    likely will be acquired by SFDC, IBM, etc.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Couldn't find any workflow / BPM companies using JavaScript, but I did
      find appery. They're definitely in the toy maker category, but what's
      interesting is that they are all JavaScript, all cloud app builder. Very
      similar to Mendix or other small vendors.

      What's more interesting is their partner list

    <h3>IBM and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>IBM was late to cloud, but pushing hard to recover</p>
    <br>
    <p>Acquiring cloud based DBaaS and PaaS companies, particularly in
    JavaScript</p>
    <br>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://strongloop.com">Strongloop: Enterprise
      Node JS</a></p>
    <br>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.compose.io">Compose: Mongo DB
      Hosting</a></p>
    <br>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://cloudant.com">CloudAnt: CouchDB in the
      Cloud </a></p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Basically IBM has been acquiring cloud and data companies for the past
      two years. Most of the cloud acquisitions have been managed services, and
      most of those are related to JavaScript ecosystem

      We shall see if IBM tries to stitch together a JavaScript / web app
      offering or just continues to offer them piecemeal.
      
      TODO: figure out IBM's cloud strategy
