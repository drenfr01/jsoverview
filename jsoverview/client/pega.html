      This is how Pega Co-browse / chat runs though

    Pega Mobile (Antenna)
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Outside of co-browse & Mobile, JS mostly for UI</p>
    <br>
    <p>Use Jquery, D3, underscore, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pega does offer REST integration points</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Avoid manual coding, maintenance issues, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Avoid "flavor of the week" that Devs seem to love</p>
    <br>
    <p>Developers only learn one "flavor" of Pega</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pega Mash-Up combines existing web applications with Pega</p>
    <br>
    <p>There's a reason UI integrated into SLC</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Mentioned earlier YUI, which is now essentially dead. Likewise ember is
      losing steam. You are at mercy of 3rd party company. Look at Google which
      initially said no upgrade path for Angular 1.0 to 2.0!

      Although good programmers can pick up any framework, it still takes time
      to learn best practices, pitfalls, etc.

      If you can't beat 'em, join them. Mash-Up is great for indirect attacks

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Frameworks like React, Angular, Meteor, etc. provide millions of $ in
    free R&D</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pega can't open source it's technology, no community sourced
    innovation (contrast with Wal-Mart)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pega is not at cutting edge of UI, particularly for more "app-like"
    functions</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>No official Pega JS API since 6.x</p>
    <br>
    <p>UI is tightly coupled to SLC, hard to incorporate things like
    Materialize, Bootstrap, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Core Pega architecture is arond request / response</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hard to implement certain things like client side DBs</p>

    <h3>Materialize vs. Pega</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Our own marketing says customers are getting spoiled</p>
    <br>
    <p>We're moving closer & closer to customer facing applications</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="http://joelcox.io/">Flashy Personal Web Site</a> vs.
    Pega Express
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      We're moving into JS's home turf. Where companies like Google and FB have
      invested an untold amount of money optimizing UI

      Random people like Joel Cox can take those tools and quickly stand up
      very pretty web sites. Customers don't know they're not maintainable
      unless we tell them. People loved Mustangs, even though they were pretty
      crappy cars. It was up to Honda dealers to explain how flashy doesn't
      mean effective or reliable.

      Pega Express looks great, worlds above our competitors I think (Oracle,
      IBM, etc.).

      But as we move closer to the customer, we're facing off against Uber,
      Google, Amazon, etc.
