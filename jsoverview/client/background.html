  <section>
    <h3>Origins</h3>

    Written in "10 days" by Netscape engineer Brendan
    Eich
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="fragment">
    Originally named LiveScript, changed to JavaScript for marketing
    </p>
    <br>

    Designed as lightweight, simpler Java (similar to VB)

    <h3>Browser Wars</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="fragment">
    JS was widely adopted in late 90s, with ES2 / ES3 gaining wide acceptance
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="fragment">
    Microsoft, after crushing NetScape in late 90s, neglected JS development
    in favor of native technologies
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p class="fragment">
    Netscape open sourced its browser code near the end, which was used to
    start the Mozilla foundation
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="fragment">
    Mozilla Firefox 1.0 released November 2004. Rapidly took market share
    from IE6 ("eight worst tech product of all time")
    </p>

    <h3>Modern JavaScript</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Web 2.0, "The Dynamic Web", began with large scale deployment of AJAX 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Sites such as Gmail(2004), Google Maps (2005), Kayak (2005) adopted AJAX
    <a href="http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/">
      ("AJAX: A new Approach to web applications")
    </a>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    JQuery, released in 2006, made cross-platform development and AJAX much
    simpler
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <pre>
      <code data-trim>
        $("button").click(function(){
            $.ajax({url: "demo_test.txt", success: function(result){
                $("#div1").html(result);
            }});
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Upshot of JQuery is that developers could write far more complex
      applications, because all JS didn't have to run and load before web page
      rendered

      Pega went with YUI (good competitive point to make, that YUI is now dead)

    <h3>Escaping the Browser</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Until 2008, JS Engines were simple interpreters that read and executed
    code</p>
    <br>
    <p>In ~2009, all major browsers except IE released new, dramatically faster
    JS Engines</p>
    <br>
    <p>Google, notably, released the V8 Engine and open sourced it</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Node JS, built on Chrome V8, released in 2009</p>
    <br>
    <p>"As an asynchronous event driven framework, Node.js is designed to build
    scalable <b>network applications</b>"</p>
    <br>
    <p>MongoDB and Couch, document based JS for its query lanugage</p>
    <br>
    <p>PhoneGap / Cordova / React Mobile - provide JS APIs to access native
    funcionality</p>
    <br>
    <p>Node quietly became default package manager and IoT service</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Notice it didn't say web applications, it says network

    <h3>Building Apps Faster</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>JS code tended to lack structures / patterns ("script kiddies")</p>
    <br>
    <p>Explosion of JS libraries / frameworks since 2009</p>
    <br>
    <p>Repeatable and maintainable ways to build complex, dynamic apps </p>
    <br>
    <p>Rise of the "Single Page App", aka thick client</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>These libraries provide opinionated way to do common tasks and often
    provide "plumbing"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Angular (2009), Backbone (2010), Ember (2011), Meteor (2012), React (2013)</p>

    <h3>The All JS Stack</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>No need to switch languages in different layers</p>
    <br>
    <p>MEAN: Mongo, Angular, Express, Node for web</p>
    <br>
    <p>JSON for data transport, Grunt for build tools, Npm for packages,
    testing frameworks, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Node + Express is default way of creating an IoT</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>What's special about JS right now?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Number of convergent streams</p>
    <br>
    <p>Evolution away from LAMP stack (default of web apps)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Return of thick client (can't rely on request-response)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Big change from stateless to stateful</p>
    <br>
    <p>Distributed computing with smartphones</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      websockets in lieu of statless HTTP requests
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Only cross-platform solution (sometimes better than Native)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Heavily optimized due to Browser wars</p>
    <br>
    <p>ECMA 2015 (formery ES6) is dramatic update to JS</p>
    <br>
    <p>Robust tooling continually under development</p>
    <br>
    <p>No other stack has ever been this complete with one language </p>
