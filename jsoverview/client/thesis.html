         Note that the definition of thick client is changing. Mobile apps are
         more traditional thick clients, but we also mean things that run
         locally on the browser as thick clients. In many ways the browser is
         the new OS (tighter integration with GPUs)

         up yet, toy builders with 10x productivity (toy builders 2.0)

         Can dismiss toy builders (Mendix, Decisions, etc.)
